# The structure is simply indexes & leaf pages

* Index pages contain links & thumb nails to child directories
* Leaf pages contain actual content (HTML, images, videos)

# Navigation
* Bread crumbs are generated automatically to navigate the structure
* Previous & next links generated automatically using alphabetic sorting by source file name

* Provide download links for content?
